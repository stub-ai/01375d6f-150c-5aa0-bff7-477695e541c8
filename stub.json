The app should include services for user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, and order processing. Each service should be independently deployable and communicate with others via REST APIs. The user authentication service should handle user registration and login. The product catalog service should allow adding, viewing, and searching for products. The shopping cart service should manage adding and removing items from the cart, and the order processing service should handle order creation and status updates. Please include a basic frontend to interact with these services.","md5":"776c4fd9771a04994aeea26a01e55089"}]}
